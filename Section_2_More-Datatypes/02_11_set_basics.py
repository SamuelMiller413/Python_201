# With the given sets `s` and `t`, demonstrate how you can:
# - Create an intersection of both sets
# - Create a union of both sets

s = {1, 2, 3, 4}
t = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# - Create an intersection of both sets
print(s.intersection(t))
# -or-
print(s & t)

# - Create a union of both sets
print(s.union(t))
# -or-
print(s | t)
