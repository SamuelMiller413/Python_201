Do an online search for interesting Python packages on PyPI.
You can search for something you're interested to do with your programming
skills and add "Python package" to the search query.
- What do you find?
- Create a new virtual environment and install the package.
- Check out its documentation and their "Getting Started" guide
  and code examples, if there are any.
- Can you get some basic functionality of the package to work locally?


What I found:
  searched for 'games' on pypi,
    found typing-game 0.3.1
  
    found seagull

installed seagull
installed typing-game

Working?
neither is working. I'm really unclear as to what I'm supposed to do with them
